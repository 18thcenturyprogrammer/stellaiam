# Stellaiam 

Standard for Soul bound token(SBT) is not confirmed now (Dec 2022), but there are few brief standards. 
I chose to use [ERC 4671](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4671) as SBT interface and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) for NFT tokens.

This project's name is Stellaiam. Users connect their wallet and they can choose popular Oauth api (ex. Google, Kakao) which they get personal data from and they can choose which data will be in a SBT and opt out data which user wants to hide from others.

SBT will be made with data only from trustworthy big tech company, so others can believe the SBT from user. 


Let's talk abut real life example, Bob got the wallet address of Alice, and he wants to send some eth, but before sending he wants to make sure the wallet address is really Alice's. In this case, Bob can check Alice's SBT which shows her name on it. after that, Bob can be sure and he sends tokens to right address. 

Also, this project shows what SBT user has and how contract read fuctions work.
